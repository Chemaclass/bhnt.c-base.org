        description: `Berlin Hack and Tell is a monthly meetup where eight people present their hacks. You have five minutes followed by up to five minutes of questions. Show us code, not slides or a sales pitch!
  Follow our [Code of Conduct](https://hackandtell.org/#code_of_conduct) and show off a silly/hobby project that you can't present elsewhere. Think of it like "stand up hacking".
  Check out the past projects below and sign up on our Meetup page!`,
